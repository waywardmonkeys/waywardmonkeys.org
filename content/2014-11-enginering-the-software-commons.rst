A lot of money is floating around these days in the technical
space.  Yet not much of it seems to make its way into maintaining
our core tools, improving the overall state of the art, or doing
new Research and Development outside of trying to create a new
product within the confines of a company.

State of Things Today
=====================

Are We in a Golden Age?
-----------------------

It could be argued that we're in something of a Golden Age for our
software commons.

Resources beyond the imagination of someone in 1995 are available
to almost everyone today. Tools and services are often better than
they were in the past. Many major ecosystems are built largely or
entirely on Open Source or Free Software.

So why the Nostalgia?
---------------------

...

Past Glories
============

Looking back, many of us can remember some great research institutions
and how they changed our world and shaped much of what we have today.
We can also look back and see many research institutions whose work
has largely been lost to the sands of time.

While we view a lot of the work done by these organizations as part of
our software commons today, it wasn't necessarily seen that way at
the time. They were producing products, building entirely new
industries that underpin all that we have today, and in some cases
going down paths that didn't work out for any number of reasons.

Xerox PARC
----------

`Xerox PARC`_ was a massive powerhouse in the past. Wikipedia lists
their accomplishments as including:

* Laser printers,
* Computer-generated bitmap graphics
* The Graphical user interface, featuring windows and icons, operated
  with a mouse
* The WYSIWYG text editor
* Interpress, a resolution-independent graphical page-description
  language and the precursor to PostScript
* Ethernet as a local-area computer network
* Fully formed object-oriented programming in the Smalltalk programming
  language and integrated development environment.
* Model–view–controller software architecture

But that leaves out some fascinating other things that they did as
well such as `InterLisp`_ and `LambdaMOO`_. (InterLisp actually began
at `BBN`_ in 1967 but the team moved to PARC. BBN was also a former
powerhouse of technology R&D and is now a division of Raytheon.)

Bell Labs
---------

`Bell Labs`_ outshines everyone else in this area. (If you know of
another organization with as much impact, I'd love to hear about it.)

The `Wikipedia page`_ has extensive lists of their innovations and
inventions, but of particular interest to us here and now would be
the creation of the C programming language, Unix itself, and later
the work on Limbo and `Plan 9`_ which directly informed the work on
Google's `Go programming language`_.

IBM Research
------------

`IBM Research`_ was another major pioneer in computer science research.
Innovations developed at IBM include work in fractals, RISC architecture,
and relational databases.

MIT AI Lab
----------

While the `MIT AI Lab`_ still exists, I'm not really sure what they do
now. However, in the past, they were responsible for substantial work
in Lisp, including early Lisp Machines (spinning off LSI and Symbolics).
The MIT AI Lab is where Richard Stallman also worked on emacs. Richard
Stallman, of course, went on to found the FSF and the GNU project,
creating many of the tools that we use today on Linux.

Apple's Advanced Technology Group
---------------------------------

Apple had an `Advanced Technology Group`_ (ATG) in the 1980s and 1990s
that was responsible for work on QuickTime, QuickDraw, Newton's
handwriting recognition software, Color Sync and many other things.

Interestingly, this is also where `Squeak`_ originated!

The Apple ATG also worked on technologies like `SK8`_ and `Dylan`_.

Who's Funding What Now?

No one outside of the company knows anything about what is
happening here.

Open Source Companies
---------------------

Open source companies are interesting as they often help provide
support and development services and sometimes creating new
products. But they rarely seem to create entirely new industries,
which is interesting. They're largely focused on providing
support for existing communities and customers rather than
helping to provide essential R&D.

Other Open Source Companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Over the years, there have been a variety of other companies based on
working with open source code, including GNU and Linux, like Cygnus
Solutions, SuSE, MySQL AB, Mandriva, Eazel, CollabNet. Some of these
are still around, some have been acquired, others disappeared quietly
into the night.

Overall, here has been a great deal of consolidation and tightening
up of the pursestrings over the years.

Open Source Grants

I'd never heard of the `Comcast Techfund`_ until I started writing
this, so I don't know much about it beyond what I've read on their
website.
